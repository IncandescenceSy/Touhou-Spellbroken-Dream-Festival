Unplayed Spell Card\Defeat the spell in order to view the author's comments.\0-0
Luminous Wake\The yellow orbs are aimed at you, so just slowly scoot to the side to dodge them.\It's the first pattern in the game, so there isn't much to it. I'm...not a huge fan of[r]making simple patterns like this, but I think this turned out quite fitting for an[r]introduction to the game.\Rumia 1st\1-1
Rippling Tidal Scales\Just stay near the bottom middle and dodge what comes your way.[r]By the way, running into the familiars spawned by the bosses in this game will never hurt you.[r]Remember that for later.\A very simple spell, fitting for this early in the game.[r]And yet, something seems so elegant about it, does it not?\Waka 1st\1-2
Artifact of the 3rd Dimension\If you look at the shape in 3D, you can predict how it will turn[r]and get out of the way ahead of time.\Seiran's ability is described as "firing bullets from other dimensions".[r]I'm not sure how to interpret that, but we'll say that these bullets[r]are from the "third dimension".\Seiran 1st\1-3
Chalice Moon\The lasers push you back instead of hurting you.[r]However, if they push you into a wall, you die.[r]Lasers in this game will always be like this, so remember that for later.\The moon (behind Rumia) is full, like a filled chalice.[r]But filled with what?\Rumia 2nd\1-4
Subaquatic Current\Fight against the current constantly pushing you upwards.[r]If you hit the ceiling, you die.\The scales are intended to represent a school of fish swimming in formation.[r]By the way, it might look like you can safespot at either top corner,[r]but thanks to the gravity and the density of the bullets near the edges, that won't work.\Waka 2nd\1-5
The Moon is a Lie\The portals on the edges of the screen warp the bullets to the other side.[r]Keep track of everything around you so you won't be caught off-guard.\I'm honestly surprised I've never seen anyone else use Seiran to reference [f it=true]Portal[f it=false] before.[r]By the way, you may have noticed that each boss has two colors associated with them?[r]Seiran's colors being orange and azure is a reference to [f it=true]Portal[f it=false] as well.\Seiran 2nd\1-6
Etched Midnight\Use your own shots to make out the enemy shots.\This spell went through many iterations before becoming what it is now.[r]I'm quite proud of the final result.\Rumia 3rd\1-7
Atlantis Refraction\The angles of bullets refract upon entering the water.\The reason for refraction is because light always takes the shortest path.[r]It's as if it already knows where to go. As if it's already done it all before.\Waka 3rd\1-8
Multiverse Key\Bullet directions change counter-clockwise, so you can know how they're[r]about to turn ahead of time.\The Multiverse Key is an artifact that can open a portal to any dimension.[r]Normally it consists of seven spokes, but here Seiran is only wielding four.\Seiran 3rd\1-9
Third Ice\Each wave starts out aimed at the player, so go behind instead of ahead of the[r]aimed wave as it turns, and you'll have a significantly easier time.\The spell's name is a pun on "Third Eye".\Cirno 1st\2-1
Small Cage in a Big World\Carefully watch for bullets coming from all sides.\A somewhat simple spell, without any real tricks or gimmicks.[r]As the game progresses, straightforward patterns such as this one will get[r]rarer and rarer, so cherish them.\Mystia 1st\2-2
Primordial Roar\When the boss charges, you know the field is about to break.\This is just my attempt at a typical Kyouko pattern; nothing more, nothing less.[r]Despite its apparent simplicity, I'm quite fond of how this one turned out.\Kyouko 1st\2-3
Snowgrave\When the crystal is around you, you move much more slowly.[r]Take advantage of faster unfocused movement in order to avoid the aimed shots.\"Fine. You want to see what happens so bad?[r]Watch what happens when I cast a spell I don't know!"\Cirno 2nd\2-4
Death Note\Just focus on the area in front of you, and the bullets that you can't see won't matter.\I don't even know anything about [f it=true]Death Note[f it=false], I just thought this would be funny.[r]The pattern itself is fairly standard for Mystia.\Mystia 2nd\2-5
Shouting from the Mountain\Stay near the horizontal center and move vertically.\This was inspired by one of her spells in ISC.[r]In the end, it ended up pretty different, though.\Kyouko 2nd\2-6
Immaculate Freeze\Quickly push upwards through the waves when they freeze.\I didn't realize it at first, but this is basically[r]Mokou's "Imperishable Shooting", but Cirno-flavored. The pushback makes this spell[r]into a sort of "escalator".\Cirno 3rd\2-7
Mysticus\The further bullets are from an enemy, the harder they are to see.[r]By the way, a tip for Marisa players: her missiles will damage the familiars more than her[r]lasers, because the familiars' hitboxes are too small to be hit by all four lasers.\Sometimes I wonder if Mystia's name is derived from the word "Mysticus".[r]It's a long shot, though.\Mystia 3rd\2-8
Lethal Echo\When you shoot the boss, your shots are echoed back at you.\Inspired by a spell from the fangame ISC Reverse (aka AmanojakuR).[r]Even though it looks kind of similar, the way you play it is totally different.\Kyouko 3rd\2-9
Ringing Strings\Stay near the middle, and watch out for shots coming from all sides.\"It pulls the strings and makes them ring."\Alice 1st\3-1
Monster Under the Bed\The rice bullets are static (non-random) and symmetrical; they cross over the[r]middle the same way every time.\It's me. I'm the monster under your bed. Don't bother running; if you're reading this,[r]it's already far too late for you.\Doremy 1st\3-2
Green Orange\Push through incoming bullets instead of letting them reach you.\FOR USE IN DAIKON ONLY[r]OPERATION OUTSIDE THIS GAME[r]IS STRICTLY PROHIBITED[r]THIS IS NOT A SIMILATION, GET READY\Orange 1st\3-3
Kokeshi-Keshi Mashin\When the familiars near you, they explode into bullets. But that means they can't shoot[r]anymore after that, so maybe it's beneficial?\The spell's name is Japanese for "Doll-Erasing Machine". It's a reference to MOTHER 2 (the[r]Japanese version of EarthBound). In that game, the eraser statues from the English version[r]are doll statues instead, and this is the name of the device that removes them.\Alice 2nd\3-4
Dreaming About Sleeping\Push up through the waves as they come at you. The purple bullets are the same every time.\So this is what [f it=true]Inception[f it=false] was really about...\Doremy 2nd\3-5
Grapefruit\The more lasers you block at once, the faster they'll push you.\MAY YOU ATTAIN ENLIGHTENMENT:[r]1: BLAZING BLOODLINES[r]2: TOUCH THE UNTOUCHABLE[r]3: BREAK THE UNBREAKABLE\Orange 2nd\3-6
The Devil's Machine\Kill the flashing familiar in the order shown by the outer lifebar (or just follow reverse[r]rainbow order). Sanae's snakes won't home in on the familiars.\The spell name is a reference to EarthBound. This is far too evil of a spell for stage three,[r]isn't it? Oh well, haha. By the way, if you destroy the wrong familiar, you can still capture[r]the spell, it's just difficult because Alice's enraged phase is somewhat unfair and she has[r]high defense during it. Also, you still get just as much score for shooting the wrong familiar.\Alice 3rd\3-7
Ever-Shattered Reality\Press X or C to switch the color of your circle, in opposite directions respectively. Bullets[r]that touch the circle and match its color will aim at you.\This gimmick is very similar to that of the timeout spell from a previous work of mine,[r][f it=true]Collapse of Animism[f it=false]. But in that spell, the circle switched color on its own; you[r]couldn't control it. By the way, touching bullets with your circle gives you score.\Doremy 3rd\3-8
Descent at Last\The only way to damage the boss is by destroying the familiars. Each familiar has its own[r]behavior pattern, so you can learn how to deal with them over time.\...MY WORK HERE IS DONE.[r]NOW ONLY ENDLESS DESPAIR AWAITS YOU.[r]GOOD LUCK.\Orange 3rd\3-9
Infernal Dragon God\Push through each wave as it comes, instead of lingering inside of them.\Also known as "Angular Virtue of Geometry God".\Yachie 1st\4-1
Divine Explosive Orb\Everything is aimed at you.\balls\Misumaru 1st\4-2
Net of Archimedes\Stay in the horizontal center and move vertically.\Archimedes is often lauded as one of the greatest mathemeticians of all time. As far as[r]I know, he never invented any sort of net-like device, but clearly no one told Yachie that.\Yachie 2nd\4-3
Sacred Fountain Orb\Everything is aimed at you.\balls\Misumaru 2nd\4-4
Eternabeam\Misdirect everything away from you.\Definitely not named after a move from any monster-collecting JRPG, because that[r]would be theft! It's just a coincidence. You know, if it happens. Obviously I wouldn't[r]know anything about this.\Yachie 3rd\4-5
Mastercraft Dragongem Orb\This is effectively static, so you can do it the same way every time. Also, running into the[r]boss won't hurt you.\balls\Misumaru 3rd\4-6
Omniplex Seal\Don't let your guard down just because a bullet has passed you.\The Omniplex Seal is a field from which there is no escape. Inside of it, the shrine maiden[r]has sole domain over all gravitational force.\Reimu\4-7
Comet Inbound to SWEEPS-04\Marisa moves the same way every time, so you can memorize a route.\"SWEEPS-04" is the name of the furthest-away planet ever discovered.[r]Originally, I wanted Marisa to have a gravitational pull, moving the small stars towards[r]her, but it didn't really work out as I had envisioned, so I removed it.\Marisa\4-8
Hesperidian Grove\Everything besides the intro and the aimed lasers is the same every time, so you can[r]memorize a route.\At the grove, golden apples grow(ve). But should you attempt to pick one, you shall be[r]met with a fat [sic] worse than death. That's right, you get two puns for the price[r]of one. Aren't you lucky?[r][r]Note: I wrote this comment a few months ago and I have no idea what it's supposed to[r]mean. I think I was tired.\Sanae\4-9
Eye of Harmony\It's a totally normal attack, just happening backwards!\Has Sakuya been taking fighting lessons from Seija? I knew she could [f it=true]stop[f it=false] time, but[r][f it=true]reverse[f it=false] it? The spell's name is a reference to [f it=true]Doctor Who[f it=false]; specifically, it's named after[r]the black hole that powers time travel. By the way, the clock in her spell background tells[r]the actual time, according to your computer.\Sakuya 1st\5-1
Reversed Film\The bullets flip predictably, and they all line up.\This attack is heavily inspired by one of Kuroji Shitodo's attacks in Len'en 1,[r]Evanescent Existence. It even has the same name.\Seija 1st\5-2
Immortal Inferno\While inside the circle around you, the speed of the fireballs changes based on their color.\[f it=true]Graze Inferno[f it=false] would probably have looked something like this, had I been responsible for it.\Clownpiece 1st\5-3
Persistence of Memory\Get out of the way before time freezes.\You know, back in stage two, Cirno had a spell that slows your movement. I wonder if she[r]was attempting to imitate this? But, of course, that was only stage two, so she couldn't[r]do much with it. But as you can clearly see, now that we've entered stage five, the gloves[r]are off. I didn't realize this while making it, but although the gimmick is different, the way[r]this plays out ("keep moving or die") ended up similar to [f it=true]Deflation World[f it=false], Sakuya's Last[r]Word from [f it=true]Imperishable Night[f it=false]. By the way, the spell is named after a famous painting[r]by Salvador Dalí, which depicts melting clocks.\Sakuya 2nd\5-4
Twinsoul Switcharoo\When you attempt to move, the boss and bullets move instead.\This spell is named after a certain Touhou-style original composition, and with good reason...[r]The spell shares a gimmick with a spell from [f it=true]Collapse of Animism[f it=false], a previous work of mine.\Seija 2nd\5-5
Radiant Striped Inferno\Your aura absorbs bullets that match its color. Press X to toggle its color.\The Ikaruga gimmick fits Clownpiece so well, I'm shocked it hasn't been done before.[r]You gain score for absorbing bullets.\Clownpiece 2nd\5-6
Cicatrix Movement\When the purple knife is aimed at you, time slows, allowing you to make a dodge that would[r]normally be nigh-impossible.\This shares its name and gimmick with a specific spell from [f it=true]Spell Card Collection[f it=false] by[r]Shijimi Nono. It's not a carbon copy, but it's a blatantly obvious reference. That game's[r]rendition is infamous for being painfully difficult, but although this one isn't nearly as[r]bad, I do hope anyone who knows the original freaked out when they first saw this.[r]MegamanOmega's first impression of this will be fantastic.\Sakuya 3rd\5-7
Cascading Into the Other Side\The scales move with you if you move in the direction they're facing, but they won't[r]move back the other way.\I was inspired by something vaguely similar to this made by @yourbirlfriend on Twitter.[r]The spellname is a reference to "Cascading Worldgen", a [f it=true]Minecraft[f it=false] error.\Seija 3rd\5-8
Hellion Wake\Moons block bullets that match their color. This plays the same every time, so you can[r]memorize a route. Here's a hint for the first few waves: left, right, left.\I didn't originally intend on this being a survival, but you don't exactly get much chance[r]to properly damage the boss, so my hand was forced. I think it ended up better this[r]way, though.\Clownpiece 3rd\5-9
Sanguine Empress Palace\When the walls pull inwards, you'll need to make precise movements while very close[r]to the boss.\Originally, each stage six boss' first spell had an intro sequence that was perfectly timed[r]to the drop in the music, but it didn't really work out, so, tears in my eyes, I had to ask[r]it to leave (this is a reference).\Remilia 1st\6-1
Nirvana Lacking Flaws\This pattern is completely static, so you can dodge it the same way every time.\This spell reminds me of Fantastic Danmaku Festival 2.[r]Originally, the butterflies from above were to be plant growths, but they didn't end up[r]looking much like that in the end.\Yuyuko 1st\6-2
Malice Fountain\Carefully weave around the bullet walls when they pass you.\I originally designed this spell for Keiki, but don't tell Yuuma that. It fits her very well, anyway.\Yuuma 1st\6-3
Blood Flux\Push up through the incoming waves, instead of letting them pin you down.\It's kind of like a highly deviated take on "Danmaku Bounded Field", if you really think[r]about it.\Remilia 2nd\6-4
Blooming Void\Everything is either static or aimed at you, so you can play this the same way every time.\This was heavily inspired by the TLB of [f it=true]Sapphire Panlogism[f it=false]. It's not stealing if I call[r]it a reference, right?\Yuyuko 2nd\6-5
Catalytic Avarice\Fight against the pull, then go to the side before the boss dives.\This was inspired by her first phase's final spell in her debut game.\Yuuma 2nd\6-6
Pendulum of Fate\The large bubbles have deceptively small hitboxes.\Near the beginning of this game's development, I wasn't able to motivate myself to work,[r]and took a several-month-long break. But then I got this spell idea. I wanted[r]to make it. That was enough motivation to finally resume work on the game.\Remilia 3rd\6-7
Soulreave Petal\If you leave the circle surrounding the soul butterfly, you die.\This was loosely inspired by a specific spell from [f it=true]Fantastic Danmaku Festival 2[f it=false]. I wonder[r]if anyone will notice?\Yuyuko 3rd\6-8
Inferno Blood Vortex\If you stay near the horizontal middle, much of the pattern will simply pass you by.\Originally, a different spell was going to be in the place of this one, but it simply wasn't[r]cinematic enough to be the final spell in stage six, so I made some pretty cool-looking[r]fire lasers, and, well, things snowballed from there. Unrelated, but bullet cancels are[r]worth quite a lot of score. Just saying...\Yuuma 3rd\6-9
Old Stifled Memories\Over time, bullets become harder and harder to see. Thankfully, the boss is kind enough[r]to get nice and close to you, so you can see. Isn't that nice of her?\When I first roughed out this spell's design, my immediate reaction was "Wow, this is[r]terrible! I can't use this!". But then I made the boss chase you, and it immediately became[r]a million times more interesting. The spell is named after Tsubakura's extra stage theme[r]from [f it=true]Len'en 1: Evanescent Existence[f it=false]. It was almost named "Memories of Phantasm", but[r]then I remembered I'm not cishet.\Koishi 1st\7-1
Colossal Oomukade\The boss always chases you, so memorize a route.\This actually turned out being a much more interesting pattern than I expected, so I'm[r]very happy with it.\Momoyo 1st\7-2
Non-Newtonian Lasers\The lasers can only hit you when you move.\This is a reference to non-newtonian fluids. But upon seeing it, everyone seemed to think[r]that it was about Undertale...I guess it makes sense, but I swear I never even noticed[r]the connection.\Yukari 1st\7-3
Theomania\The player follows the circle, which you control. The further the player is from the[r]circle, the faster they will move.\This is basically just glorified ice physics, isn't it...?  By the way, Theomania is the[r]delusional belief that one is a deity, or possessed by one.\Koishi 2nd\7-4
Netherite Mining\Misdirect the explosives away from you.\Beds are used for both dragon slaying and mining, so they fit Momoyo perfectly.\Momoyo 2nd\7-5
Three Realms Under One Lens\Press X to go down a layer and C to go up. Only bullets on the same layer as you can[r]harm you. You can only hit familiars you share a layer with. Each familiar increases[r]the boss' defense, so kill them.\This was inspired by Vertical Force on the Virtual Boy, but it ended up being kind[r]of like reverse Ikaruga. You still get just as much score for shooting no matter[r]how high the boss' defense is...just saying.\Yukari 2nd\7-6
Phobophobia\When the boss charges, get far away from the bullets. This pattern is static.\Koishi just wants you to help her paint the roses red. By the way, Phobophobia is the[r]fear of fear itself.\Koishi 3rd\7-7
How to Eat Your Dragon\Misdirect the claws of familiars to where they'll deal the least harm.\I don't regret this spell's name even a little bit. As for the spell itself? Nah, this is perfect.[r]I've always thought that Momoyo's eighth spell would fit better in a scene game, so it[r]was only natural to make it worse. (Is this actually worse than the original? I'm not sure.)\Momoyo 3rd\7-8
Spell Card Phantasm\Your aura absorbs bullets that match its color. Press X to toggle its color.\Originally, this spell was an Ikaruga-style ripoff of Danmaku Bounded Field. After numerous[r]complaints from playtesters that it wasn't fun, one of the playtesters, Mugenri, agreed to[r]help make a replacement, with only a week remaining until release day (not a good time to[r]still be changing things). Mugenri sent me a rough prototype, and I spent the next two[r]days polishing it into the finished product. That makes this the only spell in the entire[r]game that I didn't make entirely by myself. By the way, the initialism of this spell's name[r]being what it is is entirely intentional.\Yukari 3rd\7-9
Spellbroken Dream Festival\DO YOUR BEST YOU HAVE EVER DONE.\W-wow, you really captured this??? I'm in awe!!![r]Say, I wonder what happens if you press [f tc=(255, 255, 0) bc=(164, 164, 0)]C[f tc=(255, 255, 255) bc=(128, 128, 128)] on the player select screen...?[r][r]The boss patterns here are all based on either the original fight or patterns[r]from the DoDonPachi games.\Final\8-1
(Skip to Boss)\DO YOUR BEST YOU HAVE EVER DONE.\This is a practice mode option. You will not get achievements, hiscores, or[r]anything else from playing this. It is purely for training.\Final Practice\8-X
(View Credits)\Rewatch the credits.\8-X
Praecantor Patche\I have no more hints for you. You've done such a good job to this point.[r]You can do it! Don't give up!\Huge thanks to Mugenri for drawing her crystals (he also drew Flandre's options) and to[r]Naudiz for helping code the transition shader and crystal maze generator. This spell took[r]a very long time to make. The hint is a reference to EarthBound, and the spell name is a[r]reference to Bell Spell. By the way, if you time it perfectly, you can hit two charge shots[r]before the first crystal maze. This spell is a lot uglier with Misc. shaders off...[r]Oh, and the bullet cancel bonus matters a lot for scoring.\Patchouli a\9-1
Blade of Rune\I have no more hints for you. You've done such a good job to this point.[r]You can do it! Don't give up!\Youmu is doing her best impression of Balogar, the Runeblade. "Blade of Rune" is a pun[r]on "Blade of Ruin". Yes, two spells in a row have a "fire, ice, and lightning" motif. Though[r]I did make these out of order, so by the time I started this, α-1, α-4, and α-5 were already[r]done. I think this spell fits the theme of skillful swordplay well by being rapidly paced with[r]few moments to rest. It also fits the theme of "MegamanOmega's first impression will be[r]really funny". By the way, the words on the lasers are simply the names of her swords;[r]some say "Roukanken", and others say "Hakurouken".\Youmu a\9-2
Kitsune Magic of Rokuon-ji\I have no more hints for you. You've done such a good job to this point.[r]You can do it! Don't give up!\Every scene game has to have one of these in the ninth level, right? Rokuon-ji is the official[r]name of the Kinkaku-ji temple, and the word "Kitsune" in the spell's name comes from[r]Saionji Kintsune [sic], name of the owner of the villa that the temple used to be.\Kaguya a\9-3
Keitris\Left & right to move to the side, down to soft drop, up to hard drop,[r]focus (shift) to hold, shoot (Z) to rotate CW, and bomb (X) to rotate CCW.\Left & right to move to the side, down to soft drop, up to hard drop,[r]focus (shift) to hold, shoot (Z) to rotate CW, and bomb (X) to rotate CCW.[r][r]This was, by far, the most difficult thing to make in the entire game. Danmakufu isn't[r]designed to make games like this, so actually doing it is very difficult. It should be a perfect[r]recreation of every little detail of the original, so I hope you appreciate it. I also hope someone[r]makes use of endless mode. Having it conditionally insert itself into the middle of the menu[r]without breaking anything took a while to get right.\Keiki a\9-4
Keitris (Endless)\Left & right to move to the side, down to soft drop, up to hard drop,[r]focus (shift) to hold, shoot (Z) to rotate CW, and bomb (X) to rotate CCW.\Play Keitris for as long as you please!\Keiki a Endless\9-X
Infiniplex Fantasy Seal\I have no more hints for you. You've done such a good job to this point.[r]You can do it! Don't give up!\This started as sort of a "remix" of "Omniplex Seal", but it's pretty different, isn't it? Oh well.\Reimu a\9-5
Meteor Marisa\I have no more hints for you. You've done such a good job to this point.[r]You can do it! Don't give up!\Did Marisa name a meteor after herself? Or is she claiming to be a meteor? She's certainly[r]destructive enough to be one.\Marisa a\9-6
Fountain of Eternal Life\I have no more hints for you. You've done such a good job to this point.[r]You can do it! Don't give up!\Did you enjoy getting some practice with bullets coming from above and below at once?\Sanae a\9-7
Heaven-Scorching Light Of Destruction\I have no more hints for you. You've done such a good job to this point.[r]You can do it! Don't give up!\Her pure power has increased, energy can be seen radiating through her hands.[r]Level: 7,000. LP: 3,000,000.[r]This spell shares a name with the Japanese name of "Light that Burns the Sky", and I was[r]so determined to give the spell this name that I was willing to squish the text so it would fit.[r]I was tempted to squish Sariel herself, too.[r]The ambiguity in that statement is a good example of the "chaotic neutral energy" you see[r]in a lot of author's comments in games like this. How do I write like this, you ask? I'm not[r]sure, but it involves forgetting that I wrote it immediately afterwards and being incredibly[r]confused and concerned if I see it again in the future.\Sariel a\9-8
Devil Engine\I have no more hints for you. You've done such a good job to this point.[r]You can do it! Don't give up!\I'm super proud of how good this spell looks. That being said, if you have shot particles[r]turned off, the spell becomes kind of ugly, so please turn them on, for the sake of how[r]long I spent working on that effect...[r]Huh? This is the last spell? Well...thank you so much for playing! It means a lot to me[r]that you made it this far!\Shinki a\9-9
