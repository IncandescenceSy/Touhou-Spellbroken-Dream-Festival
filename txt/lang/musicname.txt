Danmaku Dream Diary\The main menu's theme.[r][r]Although I made this theme first, it was the last one to be completed, as I slightly adjusted[r]it after finishing every other track of the OST.[r]It's a rather simple play on the classic Theme of Eastern Story, with a bit of an electronic[r]touch like most of the soundtrack.
Twilight Dreamer\The first stage's theme.[r][r]I had the concept of a morning stroll in mind for this one. It's also the least electronic song[r]here to fit that thought a bit better.[r]The second half ended up oddly melancholic, but I think it works. Scene games are a pain[r]sometimes.
Imaginary Undercave\The second stage's theme.[r][r]Very clearly Len'en inspired. I may or may not have listened to a certain stage 5 theme one[r]too many times when making this.[r]A nice and simple tune for a relatively nice and simple stage.[r]Pretty proud of the arpeggios in this one.
Double Color Space\The third stage's theme.[r][r]A sudden turn for the more serious.[r]Harpsichords always struck me as an instrument that works best for either the very[r]heavy or the very light, and this is very much the former.[r]The melodies are a bit less the focus here. Just take in the background sound[r]as much as you can.
Fantasy Logic ~ Ore of Animism\The fourth stage's theme.[r][r]Things start to catch up a bit as the classic Touhou difficulty spike strikes.[r]Harpsichords again, now in a bit faster environment. There's a veeery obvious[r]inspiration in this. [r]Might have ended up a bit too derivative, but I feel like it still works.
Illusionary Hyperdimension\The fifth stage's theme.[r][r]Wild piano solos and breakbeat drumkits was definitely not a combination I expected to[r]sound good.[r]Despite that, this is likely one of my proudest tracks in this game.[r]The third melody has a bit of a heroic feel to it that drives both the song and the[r]gameplay to some extent.
Demon World Danmaku ~ Unfinished Nightmare\The sixth stage's theme.[r][r]This is the only (original) track in the soundtrack to include a key change. I rarely do them,[r]but a final stage theme deserves such delicacies.[r]Descending chord progressions capture a sense of finality quite well, so this theme is[r]almost entirely made of such things.[r]The buildup to the keychange has to be my favourite part of the entire soundtrack,[r]although this track isn't quite first place.[r]You'll see the reason soooon enough....
Another Phantasmagoria\The extra stage's theme.[r][r]A fast-paced, but somewhat light-hearted track.[r]The extra stage usually has little to do with the main incident's resolution, after all.[r]I'm really proud of the bassline in this one.[r]The whole thing, for that matter.
Everything Bleeds into Her Hands\The unknown stage's theme.[r][r]A stage theme that doesn't loop sounds a bit odd, but to be fair, they're a[r]fixed length minus the dialogue.[r]Ended up sounding a bit mocking, but I think that captures the feeling leading[r]up to the fight somewhat.[r]This track was likely the one that went through the most changes, mostly to get[r]it to the right length.
U.N. Owen as Seen in Her Dreams ~ Scarlet Dream Festival\The final boss' theme.[r][r]The one and only arrange on this soundtrack. A somewhat standard take on a[r]rather unorthodox theme.[r]Arranging this into SDF's style was pretty fun, all things considered.[r]I don't really know what else to say that ZUN hasn't said.
Dreaming Dreams of Smiles and Tears\The staff roll theme.[r][r]A nice and short ending to a relatively lengthy game.[r]Ended up capturing a sort of melancholic, end-of-the-journey feel in this.[r]Particularly a 90's video game sort of variant of that feeling.[r]Harpsichords for a third and final time. This time, they're electric. Really like the[r]sound of this, might use it in more projects eventually.[r][r]Total timeframe of composing: October 14, 2021 to January 9th, 2022 (87 days) 
Danmaku Dreamers' Revelry\The Afterparty stage theme.[r][r]The intro was meant to feel dramatic in a more inspiring fashion than a threatening way:[r]a sort of "final stretch" feel.[r]I did this track a good bit (almost a whole year) after all the others. Personally, I think the[r]improvement is noticeable, to the point where all the old tracks sort of pale in comparison.[r]And with that, my first ever complete soundtrack is done. It's been a long time, and I've[r]changed a lot since the start, and yet it still feels cohesive to me.[r]I think I'm starting to miss this game already.
